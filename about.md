Hi. I'm David. I've been many things: Developer, Advocate, and now Headhunter.

Originally from the UK, I now live and work in Ottawa, Canada.

I play a lot of boardgames, and in my spare time I'm building [meeple.me](http://meeple.me) to help facilitate that.

During the day I work at [Shopify](http://shopify.com), where I find the best and brightest developers and tell them they want a job with us.
