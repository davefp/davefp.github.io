Hi. I'm David. I've been many things: Developer, Advocate, Headhunter, Tutor.

I'm writing a book called **Healthy Webhook Consumption with Rails**. You can buy it for $10 from [webhookbook.com](https://webhookbook.com)

Most of my personal projects are open-source and can be found on [my GitHub profile](http://github.com/davefp).

Originally from the UK, I now live and work in Ottawa, Canada.

I play a lot of games, both the [cardboard](http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/davefp) and [electronic](http://steamcommunity.com/id/davefp) variety.

I currently do freelance Rails tutoring/mentoring. If you're interested in hiring me, please get in touch at [david@theflyingdeveloper.com](mailto:david@theflyingdeveloper.com)
