Hi. I'm David. I've been many things: Developer, Advocate, Headhunter, Tutor.

Most of my personal projects are open-source and can be found on [my GitHub profile](http://github.com/davefp).

Originally from the UK, I now live and work in Ottawa, Canada.

I play a lot of games, both the [cardboard](http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/davefp) and [electronic](http://steamcommunity.com/id/davefp) variety.

I'm currently searching for a full-time developer position. Preferably Rails, preferably in Ottawa. If I'm the kind of dev you want on your team, drop me a line [david@theflyingdeveloper.com](mailto:david@theflyingdeveloper.com)
