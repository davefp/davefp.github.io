I have already had some feedback on [wp-reactions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-reactions/), which is great! The plugin was downloaded more than 50 times in the first 12 hours of being online, which I'm really pleased about. What I want to do is share with you guys the direction I will be taking the plugin in. I will link to this post from the plugin page and keep it up to date as new releases come out.


#### Current Features (version 0.6.6)


Features that are working in the current version:



	
  * Add reactions to new posts. **100% complete**

	
  * Manage reaction descriptions for future posts. **100% complete**

	
  * Ability to apply reaction updates to all existing posts (not just new ones). **100% complete**

	
  * Add CSS classes to the generated markup to allow authors to style the form as they see fit. **100% complete**

	
  * Include an option to add 'question' text before the reaction form. **100% complete**




#### Upcoming Features


Features that I am currently working on:



	
  * Have different sets of reactions for posts in different categories. **0% complete**

	
  * Add a cookie/IP based filter to prevent users from posting the same reaction multiple times. **0% complete**




#### Future Features


These are features that I want to include in the plugin at some point, but do not have a concrete plan for yet:



	
  * Stats Tracking. **0% complete**

	
  * Give authors the option of making the reactions mutually exclusive (i.e. Users can only check one reaction per post). **0% complete**

	
  * Internationalize plugin. **0% complete
**
