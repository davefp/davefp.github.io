[![](/a/2011-10-10-cool-gadget-power-bag/powerbag.png)](http://www.mypowerbag.com/)I can't remember who told me about this, but about a month ago someone sent me a link to [Power Bag](http://www.mypowerbag.com/). It's a series of backpacks, messenger bags and briefcases that come with a built-in battery pack that you can use to charge your phone, tablet, or other usb device while out and about. The idea is that you charge it at home from the mains, then plug your phone (or whatever) into it while you're out so that it recharges while you're in transit. Pretty clever!

I'd love to see this coupled with a dynamo accessory so that you could mount it to your bike and charge the bag while cycling. If I hadn't recently bought a [Thule messenger bag](http://www.thule.com/en-US/CA/Products/Luggage/LuggageAndPacks/Crossover%E2%84%A2-12L-Messenger-Bag) for my work laptop (which I love by the way), I'd definitely try one out.
