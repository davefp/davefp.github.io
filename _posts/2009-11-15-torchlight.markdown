Over the last few days I've been playing an awful lot of [Torchlight](http://www.torchlightgame.com/). There's nothing I can say about it that hasn't already been said by people far more qualified than me on the subject, but I thought I'd add my voice to the discussion by saying: It's Awesome. Here's my character, whose name is Ivan (click to embiggen):

Ivan is a 'Destroyer'. That's the name of his class. That's pretty awesome.Â  He has a dog called Boris who periodically goes back to town and sells all the loot Ivan picks up. That's pretty awesome. Ivan's shield is so big that it clips his shoulder-pad. That's pretty awesome. [This game has a demo available](http://www.torchlightgame.com/). Go try it right now!
