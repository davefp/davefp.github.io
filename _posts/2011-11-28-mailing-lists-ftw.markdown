Part of my job is to interact with third-party developers and help them out when they have issues with the [Shopify API](http://api.shopify.com). This used to be done on our forums and was, in no uncertain terms, _terrible_.


## Pull


The trouble with forums generally is that they're not designed to push topics to you; You have to go to them to get updates. This is great if you're a casual user but when you're an administrator who needs to read **everything** that gets posted, it's a hassle. I had to remember to check the forums constantly. It also meant that regular users weren't engaging one another as much as we wanted: More often than not initial responses were provided by admins rather than other users.


## Push


That's why we ditched the Shopify developer forums and redirected them to a new [Google Group for developers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shopify-api). Mailing lists are by design inherently push-based, so now the messages come to me. There are options to reduce or turn off notifications all together but judging by the number of times a community developer comes to the aid of another it seems that they prefer to get notified immediately.


## User Land


I recently had the opportunity to see things from the other side when I delved into the Dropbox developer forums. It only supports RSS updates (boo!) so once I'd posted I had to remember to go back and check for updates. That took me 3 days. The responses I found on my return were great, but if I had been able to track the thread via email I'd have known a lot sooner. I also find myself with no desire to go back and read through topics to answer them.


## Alternatives


[Google Groups](http://groups.google.com) are fantastic, but they're not for everyone. The Ottawa Android group that I attend uses [Libre List](http://librelist.com/) which is a far lighter weight solution. A quick google search reveals many more possibilities.
