I have a new job! This means that instead of being gainfully unemployed, I now get to spend my time working on [Gazaro.com](http://gazaro.com). I've not worked in a start-up before, and the atmosphere is a refreshing change. There are no clients to deal with, no stifling management to report to and tonnes of new technologies to learn. To give you an idea, here's a list of all the new stuff I've worked with since I started there last week:



	
  * Python

	
  * Google App Engine

	
  * Google Protocol Buffers

	
  * Google DataStore

	
  * Amazon's SimpleDB

	
  * Django templates

	
  * Git


Feeling that my skillset was stagnating was one of the reasons that I left my last job, so being exposed to so many new ideas and methods is perfect. That's all I have to say on the matter right now, but I'm sure I'll have updates over the next weeks and months on any cool stuff that I do while I'm there.
