[![Inflatable Apps](/a/2010-05-14-new-project-inflatable-apps/inflatableicon.png)](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/inflatableicon.png)A few weeks back [I linked to an interview](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/the-flying-developer-gets-interviewed) that I did about an Android app that I have been working on. Well, the app is just a part of a larger project that I've been thinking about for a while. I call it [Inflatable Apps](http://inflatableapps.com).

Inflatable Apps is an umbrella title that I created to allow me to brand my android apps starting with [TumTum](http://inflatableapps.com/apps/tumtum/), the app from the interview. Any and all apps for the android platform that I create will be released under the Inflatable Apps name.

There's more to it than that though. Aside from myself, I know a number of people who are interested in android development. Behind the scenes, I want Inflatable Apps to offer a collaborative and friendly environment for developers that I know to work in and ultimately publish their completed apps under. I'm hoping that by doing this our apps will reach more people and gain a reputation for quality.

The Inflatable Apps website is now live at [http://inflatableapps.com](http://inflatableapps.com). The developer community is currently at an embryonic stage, but now that the site is up there is extra incentive for others to get involved. I also have my own ideas for new apps, so if nothing else those will be going up soon.

I'm excited about the potential Inflatable Apps has to produce excellent mobile applications for the android platform. Please check the site out, and let me know what you think!
