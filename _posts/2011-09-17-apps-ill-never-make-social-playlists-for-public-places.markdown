[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/5736021423_be71f2457a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/50964738@N07/5736021423)[Soundhound](http://www.soundhound.com/) and [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com/) are great, but what if you want to know about the song that just _finished _at the bar/coffeeshop/store you're in? This app would allow people playing music in public places to upload/update their playlist to a site tagged with their location, and then users would connect to find out what's playing near them.

From there you could do all kinds of interesting things, like having users request songs or [foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) integration that tailors the playlist for whoever's checked in at the time based on their combined [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) history.

Maybe something like this already exists, I'm not sure. I'm not exactly the most prolific music listener ever. If it does, I'd love to hear about it!
