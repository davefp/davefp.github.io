No proper post this week, as I've just moved into a new apartment and all my time is being spent on unpacking and setting up utility bills. It's 100% worth it though, as I now live 5 minutes walk from work. Thanks to [Dan](http://dan-menard.com), [Edward](http://twitter.com/edwardog), and [Kim](http://dorkwithaneedle.com)'s family for helping me transport all my stuff across town.

Here's a picture of my new TV :D
