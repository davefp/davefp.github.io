I love my phone. It's an HTC Dream (AKA the G1) and was the very first Android-powered phone. This is actually the second one I've owned, the first stopped being able to hold a charge a while back. I'm running Cyanogen Mod 6.0 which in all honesty  is more than the phone can comfortably handle memory-wise. However I recently made a  couple of tweaks that really helped performance so I thought I'd share them here (This is actually a re-working of a post [I submitted to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/f92hr/all_a_couple_of_tips_for_performance_on_older/) recently, but I think it deserves a permanent home here too).

First, I checked the option in Cyanogen Mod Settings to keep the home  app in memory at all times. I used to find that pressing the home  button would result in the screen freezing for a good 5-10 seconds. Now  it comes back instantly. This alone will probably extend my usage of the  phone for a few months before I decide to upgrade.

Second, I switched my launcher app to [Zeam Launcher](http://www.appbrain.com/app/zeam-launcher/org.zeam)

Zeam is designed as a lightweight launcher and I like it a lot. It's no  longer in development but the current version is great and I highly  doubt I'll be trying any more recent roms that it might not work with.

I imagine that this will help performance on other older devices, but naturally your mileage may vary.
