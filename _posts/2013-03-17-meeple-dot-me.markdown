About 6 weeks ago I started a new side project: [Meeple.me](http://meeple.me). Here’s what it’s about.

Meeple.me is a webapp for people who organize board game events. It aims to answer the following question:

> What are we playing tonight?

It does this by asking everyone attending an event two questions.

1. What games can you provide?
2. What games do you want to play?

The available answers for the second question are seeded with the responses to the first.

24 hours before the event is due to take place the app tallies up the votes for each game and tells the owners which ones they should bring.

__That’s it.__

I’m not working on this alone. I’m being ably assited by [Chris Saunders](https://twitter.com/chris_saunders) and [Ryan Coleman](https://twitter.com/coleman811), developer and designer extrordinaire respectively. I’m helping out with the coding as well as playing product manager.

I’ll be posting updates here and if you’re interested we’re taking newsletter signups at the homepage here: [Meeple.me](http://meeple.me).
