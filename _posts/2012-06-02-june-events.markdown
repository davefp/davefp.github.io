This month is going to be busy for me travel-wise.

First up is HackMTL on June 9th (That's next week!). This latest instalment of the [Hack Days](http://hackdays.ca/) series has a social bent and Shopify will have a $500 prize for the best Shopify app at the event. If you're in Montreal I definitely recommend checking it out. [Head to the event page and sign up](http://hackmtl2012-es1.eventbrite.com/?ebtv=C)!

The really big news is that I've been invited to attend [Google I/O](https://developers.google.com/events/io/) at the end of the month. I didn't even try to get a ticket when they went on sale, I had resigned myself to thinking it was futile. Then out of the blue, I got an email from Google saying they were giving me a free ticket. Score! I'm attending with [Carson](https://twitter.com/#!/carson_) and [Cody](https://twitter.com/#!/codyfauser) from Shopify and I'm really looking forward to it.
