My new job is keeping me extremely busy, but I want to collect my thoughts after working my first week at [Shopify](http://shopify.com). Here's a quick breakdown of things that happened over the last 7 days:




  * On [election day](http://www.elections.ca/home.aspx), our CEO [Tobi](http://twitter.com/#!/tobi) posted that we should take time off to go vote if we needed to. I can't vote (because I'm all foreign and stuff) but it demonstrated just how flexible work environment here is. Got something important to do? Go do it!


  * My main contact in my department was away when I started, so he took the time a few days before to make a video-tour of the office introducing people so that I wouldn't be totally lost when I arrived. [Edward](http://twitter.com/#!/edwardog) is a properly excellent person, and he's involved in all kinds of [cool](http://awesomeottawa.ca/)[stuff](http://opendataottawa.ca/).


  * My boss [Harley](http://twitter.com/#!/hfizzle) got hold of one of [these](http://www.hasbro.com/nerf/en_CA/shop/details.cfm?guid=5C866BA2-19B9-F369-1088-29DD6A10762B&product_id=27420&src=endeca) and promptly announced that he was going to assault the Sales department with it single-handed. I'm glad he's on my side.


  * I forgot to check [Reddit](http://reddit.com) for an **entire day**. This is unprecedented.


This post probably sounds like a recruitment pitch for Shopify, but I'm honestly having a really great time working there. The Reddit thing seems trivial, but I'm finding that my actual work is more interesting than reading [rage comics](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu).
