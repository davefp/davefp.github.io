Man, the hype around the Google Wave preview is enormous!

I have watched 2 videos concerning Google Wave: [The unveiling at Google's IO conference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ) earlier this year which is 1.5 hours long, and the following one.

Much shorter!

I wish I actually had something to say about Google Wave other than how awesome it looks in principle. I even got an invite to the preview last week. Trouble is, none of the invites I sent out have arrived yet. This means that I have but one person on my contact list (the person who invited me). Seeing as Wave is billed as a collaberation and group chat tool, having just one person isn't really worth it. Apparently Google is staggering the release of invites so that they can maintain stability and speed. This is completely understandable, but it's frustrating to have access to such a wonderful new service and have no-0ne to play with... *sigh*

Hopefully some of my other friends will get in soon, and then I'm sure I'll have plenty to sat on the subject.

**P.S.** No, you can't have an invite. Sorry.
