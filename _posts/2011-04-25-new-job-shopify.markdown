I'm proud to announce that I'm starting a new job in May: I've accepted a Developer Advocate position at [Shopify](http://shopify.com). This will involve doing all sorts of crazy work on/with their [api](http://api.shopify.com/), including helping people develop top-notch apps for the [Shopify app-store](http://shopify.com/tour/appstore).

You might be able to tell that I'm pretty damn excited about this, but I'm also sad that I'll be saying goodbye to the good folks at [Apption](http://apption.com) that I currently work with. They're a stand-up company and I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a solid tech job in Ottawa.
