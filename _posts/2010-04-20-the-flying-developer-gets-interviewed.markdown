Want to see me flail around on camera and talk too fast about Android development? Here's an interview I did completely at random while I was at PAX last month about a personal Andorid project that I'm working on. The guys interviewing me are from [ftwapps.com](http://ftwapps.com) which is more of an iPhone app review site but they were happy to let me ramble on about how much I like Android. Enjoy!
