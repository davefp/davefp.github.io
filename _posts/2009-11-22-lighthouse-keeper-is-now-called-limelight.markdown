As stated in the update on my previous blog post, there is already a Lighthouse-related app called Lighthouse Keeper. Bummer.

Still, not to worry. To avoid confusion and general awkwardness, I'm going to change the name of the app to Limelight. I'm pretty sure that there are no existing apps in the same domain with that name. Pretty sure. Not 100%. So if there are any app developers out there developing a Lighthouse app called Limelight... I'm sorry in advance. Hopefully I'll be ok this time though.

I'm going to release a new version of the app with the changed name in the next couple of days.
