This week I got my hands on a [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org), which if you aren't familiar is a $40 computer that's a little bit bigger than a credit card.

Now that I have one, I've decided to get my feet wet by using it as a wireless print server. With any luck I'll be able to power the Pi from the USB port on the printer itself, making it super unobtrusive.

In addition, I want to print to it from iOS devices, so I have to figure out how to get [AirPrint](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4356) working.

This isn't my first time at the rodeo. Back in university I ran [CUPS](http://www.cups.org) on my home server for a little while but that was years ago, and my sysadmin skills have atrophied somewhat in the meantime.

I'm going to document the process, and put it up here as a three-part guide for others to follow. The best part about writing a tutorial is that you have to have a solid grasp of the topic yourself.

I'll add the links to the various parts as they're written, so check back here for updates. The first one should be going up later this week.

* __Part 1__: Initial setup, installing and configuring CUPS
* __Part 2__: Adding a printer, printing something
* __Part 3__: AirPlay support, printing from an iPad
