[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) was the instant first choice, but seeing as everyone on the project was an experienced web developer/designer, we found we needed a little more control than the free option offered us.

I had a quick think and remembered [Edward](http://twitter.com/#!/edwardog) extoling the virtues of [PHPFog](http://phpfog.com).

Wordpress is written in PHP, and PHPFog (like Heroku) has a free plan with just enough resources to get a site off the ground.


> "Perfect!" I thought. "There must be a way to get Wordpress on there!"




# Easy Peasy


Turns out there is, and it's really easy. As soon as you create an account with PHPFog, you're taken to a page with a big list of commonly installed apps that you can drop onto your (shared) app server and Wordpress is right at the top.

From there it was a breeze: We filled in the login info we wanted and the PHPFog back end did the rest. It took a few minutes for everything to spool up, but once it did we had our very own Wordress installation to play with and tweak to our hearts content.


# Scaling Up


Naturally the resources available on the free plan wouldn't stand up to a huge amount of traffic, but at that point one could easily upgrade or export one's content to be relocated elsewhere.

So, if you find yourself in need of a pop-up wordpress instance on the cheap, have a gander at [PHPFog](http://phpfog.com)!
