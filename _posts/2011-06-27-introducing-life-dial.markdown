My latest project is now available for download: [Life Dial](http://inflatableapps.com/apps/life-dial/).

[![](/a/2011-06-27-introducing-life-dial/device-2011-06-26-210732-180x300.png)](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/device-2011-06-26-210732.png)Life  Dial is a simple companion app for Magic: The Gathering players that  tracks your remaining life as well as poison counters. It uses a dial  control as the input for changing the life and poison totals, which I  believe to be more usable than a slider, +/- buttons, or swipes/flings.  All changes are made in a single gesture whether large or small. Big  changes can be quickly approximated with fast rotations, but fine  adjustments can still be made by simply slowing down.

The UI is as simple as I could make it. Life and Poison totals are  displayed at the top left and top right respectively, and an extra  gesture total appears to help you keep track of the current change  you're making. The menu button reveals a reset function that sets the  totals back to the standard 20/0. I'm very happy with it as it stands,  but I have plans to add a few extra features to track stats in special  game-types such as Commander.
