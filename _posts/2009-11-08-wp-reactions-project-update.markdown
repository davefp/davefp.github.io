I'm sad to admit that I've somewhat neglected [my wp-reactions Wordpress Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-reactions/) over the last few months. All the usual reasons apply: Work, real life, laziness.

It seems though that there is still interest in the plugin, so over the next few weeks I'm going to give it an overhaul. It's been a long time coming, and since I first wrote the original code I've learned a lot about the 'correct' way to program web apps.

The current code is not very flexible: In order to implement the new features that are in the roadmap, I'm going to have to start again from scratch. This time I'm going to give the plugin a proper DB back-end, so that reaction text can be updated without resetting the count, and so that posts in different categories can have different reaction options (and a lot of other things, too!). This should also make it a lot easier to maintain and add further features to.

So, if you use wp-reactions, or are holding off until some of the features you want are available, rejoice! I expect to have a new version available by the end of the year.
