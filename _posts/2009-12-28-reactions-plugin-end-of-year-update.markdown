Last time I posted about the wp-reactions plugin, I said that I planned on having a new version released by the end of the year.

The good news is that I've made considerable progress over the last six weeks overhauling the back-end to make it easier to maintain and expand. I've also learned a lot more about relational databases in the process, which is good for me if not the plugin users.

The bad news is that this process isn't finished yet, so it'll be a little while longer before there is a new version available. I hope that anyone out there who is waiting for a new release isn't too disappointed.
