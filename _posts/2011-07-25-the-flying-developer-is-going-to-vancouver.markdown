[![](/a/2011-07-25-the-flying-developer-is-going-to-vancouver/hackVAN.png)](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hackVAN.png)Are there any Vancouver hackers reading this? If so, you should come to [HackVAN](http://hackdays.ca), the upcoming HackDays event in your city. I'll be there representing [Shopify](http://shopify.com) and helping people build kick-ass things with our [API](http://api.shopify.com). We're also bringing prizes!

Having attended two of these events in the past as a participant, I'm super-excited to be on the other side of the fence and helping people out. If you're planning on coming, you should read the article I wrote about [How to Write an App in 8 Hours (or Die Trying)](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/how-to-write-an-app-in-8-hours-or-die-trying).

The event is being held on August 20th, which is the Saturday after [GROW](http://growconf.com/). The location is TBD, but I still recommend you head over to the [HackVAN registration page](http://guestlistapp.com/events/60384) and sign up. I'll see you there!
