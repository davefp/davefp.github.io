Well, here it is. I've finally come to a point where I'm happy to release my WordPress plugin to the public. I plumped on wp-reactions for the name and 0.5 for the version number. I have a number of extra features I want to get in before version 1.0.

It is by no means complete, but the functionality that is there works 100%. At least it does now. There was a bit of a panic when it first went up because I was stupid and left out some important test cases. Oops! Oh well, live and learn. The most current version (which should work) is 0.5.2. [Download wp-reactions here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-reactions/). With any luck you should be able to see it in action on this very post!
