[![](/a/2011-07-04-sticking-it-old-school/planning-225x300.jpg)](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/planning.jpg)Here's a shot from our team's first monthly planning session last week, courtesy of [Joey](http://www.joeydevilla.com/). Even though we have a huge amount of technology at our disposal, sticking post-its on the wall was the perfect way to prioritize our tasks for the next four weeks. Of course the first thing we did after this picture was taken was put the items into [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/), but physically writing everything out made it really easy to fiddle with priorities and add new items without worrying about squashing anyone else's 'edits'.

We totally stole this idea from [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org)'s scheduling sessions. I've never had the opportunity to go to an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference),Â  but from our own little experiment I can definitely see how this bottom-up approach to planning and organization has been a success there.
